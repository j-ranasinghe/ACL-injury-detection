#  ACL injury detection using MRNet dataset and Deep learning models


This was done as part of a coursework for the module CM 4604 - Research Trends

MRNet model, AlexNet model and a Vision Transformer were implemented.


## Dataset

The dataset used is the [MRNet Dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mrnet/).
